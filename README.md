The code creates a smooth fading effect for multiple LEDs connected to specified pins on an Arduino. Each LED fades in to full brightness and then fades out, one after the other, creating a visually appealing effect. The use of analogWrite() allows for varying brightness levels, while the delay() function controls the speed of the fading.
